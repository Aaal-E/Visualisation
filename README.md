# Visualisation
This project is a website, that can be used for visualising hierarchical data. The site is currently being created and isn't near ready, so a link to a working demo will be added at a later date. It will allow you to upload data in the [newick format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format), and choose between several different options to visualise this data. Multiple of these visualisations can be shown side by side, and interactions with the data will be synchronized across them. As it is very difficult to show all data at once, the visualisations will only show part of the data, and allow you to smoothly zoom in and out to reveal more. 

Most visualisations will be in 2d, making use of the [PixiJS library](http://www.pixijs.com/).
3d visualisations will however also be considered, as this might allow for visualisations that are hard or impossible to pull off in 2d. For these the [three.js library](https://threejs.org/) would be used. 

This project is created for a course at the [TUe](https://www.tue.nl/) by group D20 with the following members:
* Adrian Vrămuleţ
* Alex Thieme
* Alina Vorobiova
* Denis Shehu
* Mara Miulescu
* Mehrdad Farsadyar
* Tar van Krieken

The course runs from 23-4-2018 until 22-6-2018. The project will probably, but not necessarily, be in its finished state at that time.
